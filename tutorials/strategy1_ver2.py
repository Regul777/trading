# Strategy1: This strategy used RSI + OBV slope
# Since OBV is a leading indicator, sudden drop or rise does not mean the corresponding change
# in the price, we are hence bouding the OBV slope inorder to avoid buy/sell during that period
# Tuned values:
# for BANKING sector :
# OBV values: BUY (-30, -50) & SELL (20, 23)
# RSI values: BUY (<50: neutral or bullish) & SELL (>55: Bullish)
# Reason to buy even in neutral condition is based on the data for banking sector
# For banking sector OBV slope n = 5 (last 5 days OBV slope)
# We have used ADX in this strategy as well but that does not have much impact on the CGR
# This is because ADX should be referred to when we are not sure about the trend but for 
# uptrend stock OBV slope and RSI are enough and we don't need to refer to the third indicator
# However, ADX is very useful when  a stock is constantly moving btn. Resistance and support
# Refer to interday_strategy1.py for such a case
# Two versions of the same strategy based on enable_using_fib_retraction
# If enable_using_fib_retraction is used following are the parameters:
# R1,S1 or R2,S2 or R3,S3 depends on the state the market is in right now
# in a very bullish market R2 or R3 should be used with S1 or S2
# in a very bearish market R1 should be used with S2 or S3
